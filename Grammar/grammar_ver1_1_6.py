# Grammar

## Timing Rules

- `cron(String)` defines the starting point using UNIX cron. It re-triggers the scenario regardless of blocking.
    - `cron = ''` : Start immediately. No further cron triggers.
- `period(Integer)` **controls loop after starting:**
  - `period = -1`: run once on cron, then stop forever
  - `period = 0`: run once per cron trigger
  - `period ≥ 100`: repeat every `period` ms after cron
- When the code is blocked, new period trigger is ignored.
- `for` or `while` is not allowed. All periodic execution must be controlled through `cron`(Periodic triggers) and `period`(loop).`

### Example Scenarios

- Run once immediately: `cron = ""`, `period = -1`
- Run at 9:00 AM: `cron = "0 9 * * *"`, `period = -1`
- Run once every hour: `cron = "0 * * * *"`, `period = 0`
- Monitor every 10s from now on: `cron = ""`, `period = 10000`
- Monitor from 9am daily: `cron = "0 9 * * *"`, `period = 100`

## Declaration of Global variables

- Global variables (`:=`) preserve state across periods, but are reset on each new cron trigger.
- They should be just below cron and period, initialized using `:=` .
- Variables declared within the code block are scoped to the current period execution.

```
// open_duration increments by 1000 every second.
cron = ""
period = 1000
open_duration := 0
if ((#ContactSensor).contactSensor_contact == "open") {
  open_duration = open_duration + 1000
}
```

## Device Access with Tags

Each device has pre-defined Tags (e.g., device type, location, group).
Use `(#<Tag1> #<Tag2> ...)` to select devices.
When multiple tags are used, devices which have *all* of the listed tags are selected. (AND condition)
You don't necessarily have to use device tags. The combination of different tags, methods, and attributes can determine devices.
Only use pre-defined Tags and Device Skills(attributes, methods)

- Format: `(#Tag).attribute` or `(#Tag).method(arg)`
    
    ```
    // Get the current target temperature of the air conditioner in sector A.
    temp = (#AirConditioner #SectorA).airConditionerMode_targetTemperature
    
    // Set the air conditioner temperature to 20 degrees
    (#AirConditioner).airConditionerMode_setTemperature(20)
    ```
    

## **Condition Logic**

- `if (condition)`, `if ((conditionA) and (conditionB))`, `if ((conditionA) or (conditionB))`, `if (condition) { } else if (condition) { } else { }`: single-time condition check
- `break` immediately terminates the current period execution and stops all future period-triggered executions for this scenario. However, new cron events can still trigger the scenario again.
    - cron = "", period = 1000: checks every 1s until break is encountered, then stops permanently (no more period triggers).
    - cron = "0 9 * * *", period = 1000: if break occurs, stops current daily execution, but will restart at next 9 AM.

## Blocking Operations

- `wait until(condition)` : Waits for a condition to become true
- `(#Clock).clock_delay(hour: int, minute: int, second: int)`: Pause for fixed time (summing all arguments)
- **blocking operations** suspend execution **within the current period**.
    - While blocked, **period triggers are ignored** and resume only after the condition or delay is met.
    - **Cron triggers override** any blocking operation and start a new execution immediately.
    - Enables event-driven or timed behavior **within periodic scenarios(period >= 100)**.

## all & any

- `all(#Tag).method()`: Apply a method to **all** matching devices. No return value.
- `all(#Tag).attribute == value`: Check a condition across all matching devices, returning true if all devices satisfy the condition
- `any(#Tag).attribute == value`: Check a condition across all matching devices, returning true if any device satisfies the condition.
    - Check at least one light is on: `if (any(#Light).switch_switch == 'on')`
    - Wait at least one light is on: `wait until(any(#Light).switch_switch == 'on')`
- Use `all(...)` or `any(...)` **only if** the user explicitly requests applying to all devices or checking across all devices.
    
    ```
    // If any temperature sensor in sector A reads above 30 degrees, turn on all fans.
    if (any(#SectorA).temperatureMeasurement_temperature > 30.0) {
      all(#Fan).switch_on()
    }
    ```
    

## Arithmetic and Boolean Conditions

- Arithmetic: Do not compute directly on .attribute values within method calls or complex expressions.

- Boolean Conditions:

  - Conditions within if(...) and wait until(...) must be expressions that evaluate to boolean values using comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=).
  - For attribute comparisons, use explicit comparison: (#Device).booleanAttribute == true
  - For any() and all() results, the expression itself returns boolean: any(#Tag).attribute == value

- Allowed operators only: =, +, -, *, /, >, <, ==, >=, <=, !=, and, or, not

```
// Valid:
temp = (#TemperatureSensor).temperatureMeasurement_temperature
adjusted = temp - 5
(#AirConditioner).airConditionerMode_setTemperature(adjusted)

// Invalid:
(#AirConditioner).airConditionerMode_setTemperature( (#TemperatureSensor).temperatureMeasurement_temperature + 5)
```

## Tips:
- Multiple devices may perform the same functional behavior using different tags or methods. Choose the appropriate one based on available devices.
  - Siren: (#Alarm).alarm_siren(), (#Siren).sirenMode_setSirenMode('siren')
  - Presence: (#PresenceSensor).presenceSensor_presence, (#OccupancySensor).presenceSensor_presence
- Always check the available service list and use devices defined in your environment.
- Some user inputs may not be executable due to missing or unsupported devices. Use (#Speaker).mediaPlayback_speak(...) to explain why.

# Format

## Input

```
Current Time: "<Weekday>, <Day> <Month> <Year> <Hour>:<Minute>:<Second>"  # datetime format: "%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S"

Generate JOI Lang code for <user command>"
```

## Output
```
name = "Scenario1"
cron = "<cron expression>"
period = <int>
<global_variables> = <initial_value>
... // main logic code
---
name = "Scenario2"
...
```
**Structure Requirements:**
- Each scenario runs independently and concurrently
- No data sharing between scenarios

---

# Interpretation Rules

All scenarios must follow user commands **literally and precisely.**

- "If" (e.g., "if temperature is above 30°C") implies a **single-time condition check** using `if(elif)`.
    - When time-based operations are needed, use period + regular if-condition checks.
- "When" (e.g., "when temperature reaches 30°C") implies a **state change trigger**, requiring `wait until(...)`.
- **"Every"** statements (e.g., "every 5 minutes") require appropriate `cron` and `period` settings.

---

# Generation Step

Let’s Think Step by Step.

## Step1. Timing
  - Set `cron` ("" for now, or schedule)
  - Set `period`:
    - -1: once
    - 0: every cron
    - ≥100: repeat in ms
  - Multiple triggers → make multiple scenarios
  - Use global vars + `period = 100` for complex timing
  - Avoid cron if state must persist

## Step2. Declare global variables
  - Declare with `:=` after `name`, `cron`, `period`
  - Use for flags, counters, etc.

## Step 3: Generate main logic
  - Follow grammar strictly
  - No `for` or `while`

## Step4. Validation
  - Ensure logic meets user request
  - Confirm grammar and structure

```
name = "Scenario1"
cron = ""
period = -1
wait until((#Pump).switch_switch == "off")
(#Speaker).switch_on()
