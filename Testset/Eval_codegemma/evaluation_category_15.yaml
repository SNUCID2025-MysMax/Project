- command: Every weekday at 9 a.m., if the windows are closed, the carbon dioxide concentration is above 1000 ppm, and the temperature is above 30 degrees, open the windows after 5 seconds and turn on the fans if they are off.Then, check in real time and if the particulate matter concentration remains above 50 for one continuous minute, close the windows again and turn off the fans.If the humidity in the greenhouse is below 40% at that time, turn on the humidifier. Similarly, if the soil humidity is below 25% and the irrigation is turned off, water the plants.

- command: Every day at 9am, if the lights are off and the window with the odd tag at the bottom is closed, open all the blinds. Then, when that window is opened, wait 5 seconds and sound the alarm's siren. After the siren sounds, check in real-time for 10 seconds to make sure that the window has never been closed, and blink the light every 2 seconds. If the blinds are open, if the door has been opened and closed more than once between then and the end of the 10 seconds, turn off all air conditioners in the wall if the second opening is longer than the first.

- command: Wait until the humidity is above 70%, then turn on the dehumidifier after 5 seconds if the window is open, and turn on the air conditioner if the temperature rises above 30 degrees after the dehumidifier is turned on. If the blinds are opened while the air conditioner is on, it will open and close the curtains every 10 seconds from then on. If it detects motion, it will turn off the alarm, and if there is no motion for 5 seconds, it will sound the alarm again.

- command: If a door is opened with the lights on and windows closed, wait 3 seconds before sounding the siren. If the window doesn't open for 10 seconds after the siren sounds, close the curtains, turn off the lights, and turn on the fan at 50% speed. Then, if the temperature is above 27 degrees, switch your air conditioner to cool mode and repeat the motion detection three times, opening and closing the blinds every second. However, if the speaker turns on in the middle, stop everything and turn it off.
