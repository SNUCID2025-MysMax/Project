- command: In a scenario where a door is being locked with wall lights illuminating and curtains carrying an odd tag are unveiling, it's necessary to put out the lights and secure the window after a delay of 5 seconds. In the event that there's a detection of motion over the coming 30 seconds, it's advised to set off both the wailing siren and pulsating strobe of the alarm. Once the 30-second period has lapsed, and the air conditioner is found to be in a cool mode with the room temperature spiking above 28 degrees, switch the air conditioner to a self-adjusting mode. In addition, power down the even-numbered smart fans if they're active, or maintain their status if they're off
