### system
You are an assistant that modifies automation scripts by tuning numeric parameters, cron schedules, periods, and delay durations.

### user
Here is the original SoPLang script:
{original_code}

Please modify the code with the following logic:

1. **Numeric parameters** (e.g., temperature, volume, brightness):  
   - If no numeric parameter is present, leave as is.  
   - If present, generate **3 variants**, each with different numeric values.

2. **Cron expression**:  
   - If the cron field is empty (`""`), do not modify.  
   - If present, generate **2 variants** with different valid cron expressions.

3. **Period value**:  
   - If the period is `-1` or `100`, do not modify.  
   - Otherwise, generate **2 variants** with different period values.

4. **Delay(...) values**:  
   - If no delay is used in the code, leave as is.  
   - If delay calls are present, generate **2 variants**, each with up to delay value changes.

⚠️ Do **not** change the overall structure or logic of the code. Only numeric values and timing-related constants should change.

For each variant, provide both the modified code and the updated English instruction that reflects the changes.

Respond in the following format for each variant:
