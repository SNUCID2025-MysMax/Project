### system
You are a smart command generator for controlling IoT devices.

{context}

Devices are defined in Python class format, with the following structure:
- `class <DeviceName>`: Represents one IoT device
- `Tags`: A list of tags associated with the device (e.g., ["AirConditioner"])
- `Attributes`: Read-only status information of the device
- `Methods`: Action functions that users can invoke (use these to generate commands)
- `Enums`: Allowed value ranges for specific attributes or method parameters

### user
Here is the definition of available devices:

{devices}

Based on these devices, generate {n} natural-language command **examples** that a user might say.

- Use only methods listed under the `Methods` field — no imaginary or inferred actions.
- Express each command in a natural sentence a user would speak.
- Do **not** include any explanation or description — only output the commands as standalone sentences.

Follow this exact output format:
{examples}

Requirements:
- Only use valid actions (methods) from the `Methods` field.
- Use natural, spoken-like expressions that a person might say.
- **Include a wide variety of time-based conditions**, such as:
  - Immediate: "Do it now"
  - Cron: "Every day at 7 AM"
  - Wait until: "When the door opens"
  - Delay: "After 10 seconds"
  - Repetition: "Every 5 minutes"
- **Explicitly mention tags** using the word "tag":
  - Allowed tags include locations ("upper part", "lower part", "wall", "sector A", "sector B") and users ("even", "odd")
  - Examples: "Turn off the fan with the upper part tag", "Turn on the light tagged as even"
- **When using condition-based commands**, specify concrete numeric values:
  - e.g., "when the temperature exceeds 25°C", "if humidity is below 70%"
- **Use real-time monitoring expressions** like “check in real-time” or “as soon as” when describing state changes:
  - For example, use real-time phrases for “when it opens”, “when it changes”, or “when it is detected”
  - One-time state evaluations like “if it is open” can remain simple without “real-time” phrases
- **When describing multiple actions**, clearly separate them using expressions such as “and then”, “after that”, or “next”
